    Task List

 !!! DO NOT FOCUS ON DESIGN !!!

+ 1. Registration
+    - Activity with input fields (login, password)
+    - Button ( onClick() send login and password on server)
+    - After OK response from server save data about registration (no need to enter login and password every time)
+    - After saving data call Main Activity

2. Replace values on template
+    - Home -> Tasks
+        -- Contains list of available tasks
        -- (feature) Add dialog for every task to check more specific information
+   - Gallery -> Map
        -- Map with addresses of every task (connect yandex maps)
        -- Some kind of labels at the task's address (with more information)
        -- Calculate the shortest path through all labels

3. Create profile
    - Personal information
        -- Name
        -- Phone number

4. Notifications
    - When user get new task
    - When user close to active task ??? think about

5. Different layouts for different size of devices


    To think about

1. How to change status
    - By hand (user change status for himself)
        -- Some kind of button or chooser
        -- Maybe on the profile page

        // uncomfortable to user, but easy to create

    - By program
        -- If user is very close to task's address, status changed

        // user may be close, but doesn't perform task

    - By notification (By user and program)
        -- Program calculate user position
        -- When user close to task's address, he gets a notification

        // i like this, but this is the hardest one

2. What kind of user data needs to be stored
    - isLogInRecently, for skipping authentication
    - Username, for profile
    // Maybe something else

3. For design
    - Editing profile (picture, username, etc.)
