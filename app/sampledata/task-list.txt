    Task List

 !!! DO NOT FOCUS ON DESIGN !!!

+ 1. Registration
+    - Activity with input fields (login, password)
+    - Button ( onClick() send login and password on server)
+    - After OK response from server save data about registration (no need to enter login and password every time)
+    - After saving data call Main Activity

2. Replace values on template
+    - Home -> Tasks
+        -- Contains list of available tasks
+        -- Add dialog for every task to change status
            --- (feature) If status == "DONE" | "IN_PROGRESS" -> delete one path from map
+   - Gallery -> Map
+        -- Connect yandex maps
+        -- Map with addresses of every task -> address was replaced by coordinates
#test        -- Calculate the shortest path through all labels

3. Replace default values in nav_header_main.xml
    - To replace
        -- Picture
#test        -- Username
#test        -- Email address


4. (feature) Notifications
    - When user get tasks
    - When user close to active task ??? think about

5. Different layouts for different size of devices


    To think about

1. How to change status
+    - By hand (user change status for himself)
+        -- Some kind of button or chooser | dialog
-        -- Maybe on the profile page

        // uncomfortable to user, but easy to create

    - By program
        -- If user is very close to task's address, status changed

        // user may be close, but doesn't perform task

    - By notification (By user and program)
        -- Program calculate user position
        -- When user close to task's address, he gets a notification

        // i like this, but this is the hardest one

2. What kind of user data needs to be stored
+    - isLogInRecently, for skipping authentication
+    - Username, for profile
    // Maybe something else

3. For design
    - Different colors for task statuses
        -- Red -> ASSIGNED
        -- Yellow -> ON_WAY
        -- Blue -> IN_PROGRESS
        -- Green -> DONE
